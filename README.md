4-constructor chaning example

5-create a class customer having field custno and custname and method getdata and showdata

6-to refer to current class method

7-to invoke current class constructor

8-constructor chaining

9-Java Program to demonstrate the use of static variable  

10-In this example, we have created an instance variable named count which is incremented in the constructor. Since instance variable gets the memory at the time of object creation, each object will have the copy of the instance variable. If it is incremented, it won't reflect other objects. So each object will have the value 1 in the count variable.

11-As we have mentioned above, static variable will get the memory only once, if any object changes the value of the static variable, it will retain its value.

12-Java static method Example of static method

13-Another example of a static method that performs a normal calculation

14-The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
this and super cannot be used in static context.

	15-Example of static block

	16-In the following program, we have created a class named Product and initialized an array of objects using the constructor. We have created a constructor of the class Product that contains product id and product name. In the main function, we have created individual objects of the class Product. After that, we have passed initial values to each of the objects using the constructor.

	17-Java Program to create and call a default constructor  

	18-Example of default constructor that displays the default values

	19-The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.
Example of parameterized constructor


20-Java Program to demonstrate the use of the parameterized constructor.  

21-Example of Constructor Overloading

22-In this example, we are going to copy the values of one object into another using Java constructor.

23-Copying values without constructor
We can copy the values of one object into another by assigning the objects values to another object. In this case, there is no need to create the constructor.

(this keyword)



1-Let's understand the problem if we don't use this keyword by the example given below:

2-If local variables(formal arguments) and instance variables are different, there is no need to use this keyword like in the following program:
Program where this keyword is not required

3-) this: to invoke current class method
You may invoke the method of the current class by using the this keyword. If you don't use the this keyword, compiler automatically adds this keyword while invoking the method. Let's see the example
this keyword

4- this() : to invoke current class constructor
The this() constructor call can be used to invoke the current class constructor. It is used to reuse the constructor. In other words, it is used for constructor chaining.

5-Calling parameterized constructor from default constructor:

6-this: to pass as an argument in the method



16 - april


1 - create  a parent class person having field name and address , create a derived class student 
inherited from person class having additional fields rno and marks.

2-  create  a parent class person having field name and address  and  create a derived class student 
inherited from person class having additional fields rno and marks. and methods getstudentddata and displaystudent data.

3-  create  a parent class person having field name and address and methods getpersondata and displaypersondata  and  create a derived class student 
inherited from person class having additional fields rno and marks. and methods getstudentddata and displaystudent data.

4- calling getpersondata method from getstudentdata method .

5- example of multilevel inheritance 
create a class person , then create a class student derived from person class and then create a class parttimestudent derieved from student class
example of hierarchical inheritance.

6 create a base class person and create a student class derieved from person class
and create another class employee derieved from person class


19 - april(overloading)

1-In this example, we are creating static methods so that we don't need to create instance for calling methods.

2-In this example, we have created two methods that differs in data type. The first add method receives two integer arguments and second add method receives two double arguments.

3-In this example, we have created two methods that differs in data type. The first add method receives two integer arguments and second add method receives two double arguments.

4-In java, method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only because of ambiguity. Let's see how ambiguity may occur:

5-Can we overload java main() method?
Yes, by method overloading. You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only. Let's see the simple example:

6-Example of Method Overloading with TypePromotion

7-Example of Method Overloading with Type Promotion if matching found
If there are matching type arguments in the method, type promotion is not performed.

8-Example of Method Overloading with Type Promotion in case of ambiguity
If there are no matching type arguments in the method, and each method promotes similar number of arguments, there will be ambiguity.

(inheritance)


1-As displayed in the above figure, Programmer is the subclass and Employee is the superclass. The relationship between the two classes is Programmer IS-A Employee. It means that Programmer is a type of Employee.

2-Single Inheritance Example
3-Multilevel Inheritance Example
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. As you can see in the example given below, BabyDog class inherits the Dog class which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.

4-Hierarchical Inheritance Example
When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance. In the example given below, Dog and Cat classes inherits the Animal class, so there is hierarchical inheritance.

5-To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same method or different, there will be compile time error.



(aggregation)


1-In this example, we have created the reference of Operation class in the Circle class.

2-In this example, Employee has an object of Address, address object contains its own informations such as city, state, country etc. In such case relationship is Employee HAS-A address.


20-april(overriding)

1-The method must have the same name as in the parent class

2-In this example, we have defined the run method in the subclass as defined in the parent class but it has some specific implementation. The name and parameter of the method are the same, and there is IS-A relationship between the classes, so there is method overriding.

3-Consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides functionality to get the rate of interest. However, the rate of interest varies according to banks. For example, SBI, ICICI and AXIS banks could provide 8%, 7%, and 9% rate of interest.

4-ex : 3 create a class account having field accountno , bal and  method deposit and withdrawl.
create a subclass saving and override the deposit and withdrawl method.

5-ex 4 create a class account having field accountno , bal and  method deposit and withdrawl.
create a subclass saving inherited from account class and override the deposit and withdrawl method.
create a subclass current  inherited from account  and override the deposit and withdrawl method.

(runtimepolymorphism)


1-In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

2-example of runtime polymorphism using account, saving and current class

(upcasting)

1-If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, it is known as upcasting. For example:

2-In this example, we are creating two classes Bike and Splendor. Splendor class extends Bike class and overrides its run() method. We are calling the run method by the reference variable of Parent class. Since it refers to the subclass object and subclass method overrides the Parent class method, the subclass method is invoked at runtime.

3-This example is also given in method overriding but there was no upcasting.

4-Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Shape

5-Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Animal

6-Java Runtime Polymorphism with Data Member
In the example given below, both the classes have a data member speedlimit. We are accessing the data member by the reference variable of Parent class which refers to the subclass object. Since we are accessing the data member which is not overridden, hence it will access the data member of the Parent class always.
Rule: Runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.

7-Java Runtime Polymorphism with Multilevel Inheritance


22-april(covariant)

1-Simple example of Covariant Return Type

()superkeyword


1-Usage of Java Super keyword
 super is used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.

 2-In the above example, Animal and Dog both classes have a common property color. If we print color property, it will print the color of current class by default. To access the parent property, we need to use super keyword.

 3-super can be used to invoke parent class method
The super keyword can also be used to invoke parent class method. It should be used if subclass contains the same method as parent class. In other words, it is used if method is overridden.

4-In the above example Animal and Dog both classes have eat() method if we call eat() method from Dog class, it will call the eat() method of Dog class by default because priority is given to local.

5-To call the parent class method, we need to use super keyword.
 super is used to invoke parent class constructor.
The super keyword can also be used to invoke the parent class constructor. Let's see a simple example:

6-Another example of super keyword where super() is provided by the compiler implicitly.

7-Let's see the real use of super keyword. Here, Emp class inherits Person class so all the properties of Person will be inherited to Emp by default. To initialize all the property, we are using parent class constructor from child class. In such way, we are reusing the parent class constructor.

(final keyword)


1-There is a final variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this variable, but It can't be changed because final variable once assigned a value can never be changed.

2-If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.

Example of final method

3- Java final class
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.

4-Is final method inherited?
Ans) Yes, final method is inherited but you cannot override it. For Example:

5-It can be initialized only in constructor.
Example of blank final variable

6-Example of static blank final variable

7-What is final parameter?
If you declare any parameter as final, you cannot change the value of it.

8-Can we declare a constructor final?
No, because constructor is never inherited.

(instance intializer block)

1-What is the use of instance initializer block while we can directly assign a value in instance data member? For example:

2-Let's see the simple example of instance initializer block that performs initialization.

3-What is invoked first, instance initializer block or constructor?

4-Program of instance initializer block that is invoked after super()

5-Another example of instance block


23-april(static and dyanamic binding)


1-If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.
Example of static binding

2-When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.
Example of dynamic binding

(abstraction)


1-Example of abstract class
Example of Abstract class that has an abstract method
In this example, Bike is an abstract class that contains only one abstract method run. Its implementation is provided by the Honda class.

2-In this example, Shape is the abstract class, and its implementation is provided by the Rectangle and Circle classes.

3-In this example, if you create the instance of Rectangle class, draw() method of Rectangle class will be invoked.

4-Another example of Abstract class in java

5-Abstract class having constructor, data member and methods
An abstract class can have a data member, abstract method, method body (non-abstract method), constructor, and even main() method.

(interface)


1-ex : create an interface shape having method declaration for draw method

2-Java Interface Example

In this example, the Printable interface has only one method, and its implementation is provided in the A6 class.

3-Java Interface Example: Drawable

4-In this example, the Drawable interface has only one method. Its implementation is provided by Rectangle and Circle classes. In a real scenario, an interface is defined by someone else, but its implementation is provided by different implementation providers. Moreover, it is used by someone else. The implementation part is hidden by the user who uses the interface.

5-Java Interface Example: Bank

Let's see another example of java interface which provides the implementation of Bank interface.
6-Multiple inheritance in Java by interface

If a class implements multiple interfaces, or an interface extends multiple interfaces, it is known as multiple inheritance.

7-A class implements an interface, but one interface extends another interface.

8-Since Java 8, we can have method body in interface. But we need to make it default method. Let's see an example:


26 april(instanceof operator and downcasting)

1-Let's see the simple example of instance operator where it tests the current class.

2-An object of subclass type is also a type of parent class. For example, if Dog extends Animal then object of Dog can be referred by either Dog or Animal class.
Another example of java instanceof operator

3-instanceof in java with a variable that have null value

4-Let's see the example, where downcasting is possible by instanceof operator.

5-Downcasting without the use of java instanceof
Downcasting can also be performed without the use of instanceof operator as displayed in the following example:

6-Let's take closer look at this, actual object that is referred by a, is an object of Dog class. So if we downcast it, it is fine. But what will happen if we write:

7-Let's see the real use of instanceof keyword by the example given below.

8-1- example of instanceof operator
2- example of instanceof operator with base class
3  with null value

9-downcasting with instance of operator

10-example of realtime downcasting example

11-downcasting example with accepting actype from the user 

(pacakge)

1-The package keyword is used to create a package in java.

2-creating a package

3-create a example to access file from another package .
do other example from the theory file


27 april(access modifiers)

1-: Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

2-: Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

3-:  Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

4-If you make any class constructor private, you cannot create the instance of that class from outside the class. For example:

5-In the above example, the scope of class A and its method msg() is default so it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
